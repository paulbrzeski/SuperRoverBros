# Super Rover Bros
A procedural WebGL night cycling game with VR support.

## Concept:
First person cycling game with Rez-like music and effects. Would be cool to do something with the music - like if a player crashes into a tree, a text to speech engine says "Tree" in a creepy voice and songs about trees start playing from Soundcloud...

## Story:
Not really necessary? A guy is out cycling? Possibly after consuming some psilocybin?

## Milestones:
- Prototype of bike and flat simple road
- Collission detection, physics, speed up and slow down
- Soundcloud integration, either play a song directly or do a search for keywords
- God rays and volumetric fog (actual, not simulated yucky 90s technique)
- Procedural path, models for obstacles and detail
